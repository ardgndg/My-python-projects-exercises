Encapsulation - While covering the basics of OOP in my previous post, I already covered about Encapsulation indirectly.
Encapsulation in simple terms means to create a container where attributes and actions associated with those attributes are grouped together.
class Avenger:
  def __init__(self, name, knownAs):
    self.name = name
    self.knownAs = knownAs

  def reveal_identity(self):
    print(f'I am {self.name}, also known as {self.knownAs}')

hulk = Avenger('Bruce Banner', 'Hulk')
iron_man = Avenger('Tony Stark', 'IronMan')

hulk.reveal_identity() # I am Bruce Banner, also known as Hulk
iron_man.reveal_identity() # I am Tony Stark, also known as IronMan
