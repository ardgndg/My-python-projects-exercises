Method Resolution Order
Method Resolution Order or mro in short, is the order in which properties and methods are inherited in Python.

When inheriting from multiple classes, the properties and methods are inherited by the child class in a specific hierarchy. The underlying algorithm that implements this in Python uses Depth first search algorithm.
class Employee:
  secret_code = 'secret'

class Manager(Employee):
  secret_code = 'm123'

class Accountant(Employee):
  secret_code = 'a123'

class Owner(Manager, Accountant):
  pass

person = Owner()
print(person.secret_code) # m123
To know the order of inheritance, Python provides a method mro that can be called on the object to view the hierarchy of inheritance
print(Owner.mro()) # try in a python console with above code to see the r
